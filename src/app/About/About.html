                    <p class="mb-20">Iâ€™m an UI/UX designer specializing in Visual design. 
                        I build clean, appealing and functional interfaces which comply with the latest web standards. but that's just a part of it. It's something I do before going to bed, and something I can't wait to do in the mornings. 
                        Without it, my world would be black and white.</p>
                    <p>As a designer I can make approach by clients who have a specific goal in their minds. My goal is to help them do their business better.</p>
